Simple Page Navigation with Page Numbers adds page numbers at the bottom for easy navigation. You do NOT need to do anything in the code, just activate the plugin and the pagenumbers will appear.

Of course in this way the old previous and next links will still remain, if you would like to remove those then you will have to edit the files to remove them. But normally it should be also ok to keep them. The page numbers will appear before these links, so it should be pretty nice.

Simple Page Navigation with Page Numbers is based on the prime strategy page navi, but enhanced it so that you do not have to manually edit the php files to add the numbering and also has a default good looking style.
